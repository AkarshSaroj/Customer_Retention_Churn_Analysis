## 📌 Key Insights

### 🔹 From Python (churn_analysis.py)
- Distribution of churn by `Subscription Type`
- Churn distribution grouped by `Last Login Days`
- Overall churn rate (%)
- Saved visuals:
  - `churn_by_subscription.png`
  - `churn_by_last_login.png`


### 🔹 From Power BI
- Page 1: **Churn by Subscription Type**
- Page 2: **Churn by Gender**
- Page 3: **Churn by Last Login Activity**

Each dashboard page includes KPIs:
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Total Customers
- ❌ Churned Customers
- 📉 Churn Rate (%)
